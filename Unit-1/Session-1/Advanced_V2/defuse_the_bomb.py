"""
Batman has a bomb to defuse, and his time is running out! His butler, Alfred, is on the phone providing him with a circular array code of length n and key k.

To decrypt the code, Batman must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].

Given the circular array code and an integer key k, write a function decrypt() that returns the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!
