"""
You are given two strings s and t representing the stage arrangements of performers in two different performances at a music festival, such that every performer occurs at most once in s and t, and t is a permutation of s.

The stage arrangement difference between s and t is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each performer in s and the index of the occurrence of the same performer in t.

Return the stage arrangement difference between s and t.

A permutation is a rearrangement of a sequence. For example, [3, 1, 2] and [2, 1 , 3] are both permutations of the list [1, 2, 3].

Hint: Absolute value function
