"""
In a wildlife research station, each letter of the alphabet represents a different observation point laid out in a single row. Given a string station_layout of length 26 indicating the layout of these observation points (indexed from 0 to 25), you start your journey at the first observation point (index 0). To make observations in a specific order represented by a string observations, you need to move from one point to another.

The time taken to move from one observation point to another is the absolute difference between their indices, |i - j|.

Write a function that returns the total time it takes to visit all the required observation points in the given order with one movement.
