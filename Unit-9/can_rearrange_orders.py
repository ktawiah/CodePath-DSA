"""In your bakery, customer orders are each represented by a binary tree. The value of each node in the tree represents a type of cupcake, and the tree structure represents how the order is organized in the delivery box. Sometimes, orders don't get picked up.

Given two orders, you want to see if you can rearrange the first order that didn't get picked up into the second order so as not to waste any cupcakes. You can swap the left and right subtrees of any cupcake (node) in the order.

Given the roots of two binary trees order1 and order2, write a function can_rearrange_orders() that returns True if the tree represented by order1 can be rearranged to match the tree represented by order2 by doing any number of swaps of order1â€™s left and right branches.

Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.
